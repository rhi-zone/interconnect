Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

## Overview

Interconnect is a federation protocol for persistent worlds. It enables Lotus servers to form interconnected networks where players can travel between worlds owned by different authorities.

### Key Concepts

**Authoritative Handoff (Not State Merging)**

Unlike Matrix-style federation that merges state from multiple servers, Interconnect uses single-authority ownership:
- Each world/room is owned by ONE server at a time
- When you move between worlds, you disconnect from Server A and connect to Server B
- No state resolution algorithms, no split-brain attacks, no history rewriting

**Intent-Based Protocol**

Clients send Intent, not State:
- Client: "I want to move north" (Intent)
- Server: "You are now at (5, 3)" (Snapshot)
- Clients cannot inject state; servers are authoritative

**Two-Layer Architecture**

1. **Substrate (Replicated)**: Static world definition (geometry, textures, base description). Content-addressable, cacheable everywhere. Survives server death.
2. **Simulation (Authoritative)**: Dynamic world state (physics, player positions, door states). Single server, not replicated. Pauses when server dies.

### Protocol Primitives

- **Manifest**: What this server allows/requires
- **Intent**: Client requests action
- **Snapshot**: Server broadcasts world state at tick N
- **Transfer**: Server hands off player to another server with passport token

### Import Policies (Customs)

When players transfer between servers, their "passport" (inventory, stats) goes through validation:

```rust
fn on_player_enter(passport: Spore) -> Player {
    let mut player = Player::new();
    player.health = passport.health.clamp(0, 100);
    for item in passport.items {
        if self.allowed_items.contains(&item.id) {
            player.give(item);
        }
    }
    player
}
```

### Ghost Mode

When authority connection is lost:
- World desaturates / shows static effect
- Player becomes observer (client-side collision only)
- Can't interact, but world doesn't disappear
- Substrate (static world) remains visible

## Core Rules

**Note things down immediately — no deferral:**
- Problems, tech debt, issues → TODO.md now, in the same response
- Design decisions, key insights → docs/ or CLAUDE.md
- Future/deferred scope → TODO.md **before** writing any code, not after
- **Every observed problem → TODO.md. No exceptions.** Code comments and conversation mentions are not tracked items. If you write a TODO comment in source, the next action is to open TODO.md and write the entry.

**Conversation is not memory.** Anything said in chat evaporates at session end. If it implies future behavior change, write it to CLAUDE.md or a memory file immediately — or it will not happen.

**Warning — these phrases mean something needs to be written down right now:**
- "I won't do X again" / "I'll remember to..." / "I've learned that..."
- "Next time I'll..." / "From now on I'll..."
- Any acknowledgement of a recurring error without a corresponding CLAUDE.md or memory edit

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**When the user corrects you:** Ask what rule would have prevented this, and write it before proceeding. **"The rule exists, I just didn't follow it" is never the diagnosis** — a rule that doesn't prevent the failure it describes is incomplete; fix the rule, not your behavior.

**Something unexpected is a signal, not noise.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, files containing what they shouldn't — stop and ask why before continuing. Don't accept anomalies and move on.

**Do the work properly.** When asked to analyze X, actually read X - don't synthesize from conversation.

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this crate/module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps, incomplete pagination, or unexposed trait methods
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer
- **Verify before stating:** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking

## Design Principles

**Authority over consensus.** Single server owns each world. No state merging, no conflict resolution.

**Intent over state.** Clients declare intent, servers compute results. Never trust client-provided state.

**Graceful degradation.** When authority dies, fall back to substrate. Static world is better than void.

**Explicit import policies.** Each server defines what it accepts from transfers. Contraband is rejected, not silently dropped.

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**Always commit completed work.** After tests pass, commit immediately — don't wait to be asked. When a plan has multiple phases, commit after each phase passes. Do not accumulate changes across phases. Uncommitted work is lost work.

**Use `normalize view` for structural exploration:**
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Context Management

**Use subagents to protect the main context window.** For broad exploration or mechanical multi-file work, delegate to an Explore or general-purpose subagent rather than running searches inline. The subagent returns a distilled summary; raw tool output stays out of the main context.

Rules of thumb:
- Research tasks (investigating a question, surveying patterns) → subagent; don't pollute main context with exploratory noise
- Searching >5 files or running >3 rounds of grep/read → use a subagent
- Codebase-wide analysis (architecture, patterns, cross-file survey) → always subagent
- Mechanical work across many files (applying the same change everywhere) → parallel subagents
- Single targeted lookup (one file, one symbol) → inline is fine

## Session Handoff

Use plan mode as a handoff mechanism when:
- A task is fully complete (committed, pushed, docs updated)
- The session has drifted from its original purpose
- Context has accumulated enough that a fresh start would help

**For handoffs:** enter plan mode, write a short plan pointing at TODO.md, and ExitPlanMode. **Do NOT investigate first** — the session is context-heavy and about to be discarded. The fresh session investigates after approval.

**For mid-session planning** on a different topic: investigating inside plan mode is fine — context isn't being thrown away.

Before the handoff plan, update TODO.md and memory files with anything worth preserving.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang in non-interactive shells; stage files by name instead
- Design for "eventually consistent" semantics
- Accept state from clients
- Silently drop transfer data - either accept or reject explicitly
- Require all servers to trust each other
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment

## Crate Structure

All crates use the `interconnect-` prefix:
- `interconnect-core` - Protocol types and traits
- `interconnect-client` - Client-side implementation
- `interconnect-server` - Server-side implementation
- `interconnect-substrate` - Substrate caching and replication
